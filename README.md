# Changes

Lightweight and (hopefully) unopinionated tool for working with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## Overview

Many of the SemVer tools out there force very specific workflows that I found hard to adopt in my own projects. Changes attempts to provide a collection of tools that fit into your own project lifecycle.

## Contributing

I wrote Changes to satisfy my own minimal needs so there's a good chance it doesn't do everything you want (e.g., it doesn't support all the Conventional Commits) commit types. You're more than welcome to raise a pull request, or issue, if there's some functionality you like to see.
