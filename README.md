# Changes

Lightweight and (hopefully) unopinionated tool for working with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## Overview

Many of the SemVer tools out there force very specific workflows that I found hard to adopt in my own projects. Changes attempts to provide a collection of tools that fit into your own project lifecycle.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jbmorley/changes.git
cd changes
pipenv install
```
